Listening to podcasts while being a little unfocused does not result in anything particularly useful. Attention that keeps shifting from one thing to other doesn't even let you understand what is being said not to mention remember. Despite not being able to focus on the content I encountered some interesting ideas worth remembering.

In the "What Got You There" podcast Craig Wright, professor at Yale,talked about "genius". It is hard to define the word genius but we know those people when we see them. Wright argues that genius is more than just a braniack and a smart person. His definition of a genius is "a person who and whose ideas changed the way things are in the world, such as Einstein, Jobs and others". 

Second podcast for today was Invest Like the Best joined by John Chambers. Chambers was a CEO of Cisco for around 20 years and helped to grow it to a tech juggernaut, to survive dot-com bubble along with 2008 recession. He pointed out certain important steps of managing a company: vision, mission, culture and ZZZ. 

The second show was an episode of a16z where the host and guests talked about podcasting, future of audio and tips and tricks for those who want to start with audio content.
