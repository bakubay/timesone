"Is it that easy?". This is something I asked myself while thinking about how these people made so much money. The answer was "NO IT IS NOT".

Making money has become a growing concern of mine as I come closer to graduation. Starting a startup or running my own business, becoming a creator such aspirations fill up my head during the day and night. Well, there is not much I am doing now except for listening to podcasts. Nonetheless, they contain great ideas worth mentioning.

Form Tara's episode:
- Position your product and sell to businesses.
- Talk to people (what are their problems, what are their thoughts).
- Business plan first, development according to business plan next.
- Sell high to a small audience, not 0.99$ to a huge number of people.
- Sell first, build after. (Find interested people and build with them).

From Traf's:
- It is OK to ride waves and make money without creating evergreen businesses.
- Leveraging the hype -> work on creating a blog post, tutorials, engage with audience. (e.g creating MKBHD icon set after initial hype)
- It is never one night achievement. The foundations might be layed years ago.
- Put stuff out there. It is easier than ever before.
- ...*maybe i ll re-listen to this epidsode to add more prompts*
