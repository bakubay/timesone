There are many topics that I find interesting. Yesterday I watched a movie called “Just Mercy”; it is about a lawyer and his attempt to save wrongfully convicted African-American man in Alabama. The movie depicts flawed system through a young man who wants to help underprivilleged people. Watching it, I became very interested in the Criminal Justice System of the US, the history of racism in America, and about all different topics touched in the movie.

While my curiosity started to increase I remembered a podcast that I listened to a day before. The podcast featured Seth Godin - famous writer and entrepreneur. Some of his ideas really resonated with me, particularly, blogging every day and working to satisfy your curiosity. He said that he frequently allocates time to explain things to himself such as why Miami will be underwater in the next decade or two. Well, I will try not to take his words for granted. Starting something with a great goal is not always recommended but I already wrote what I intended to write. Therefore,time will tell.
